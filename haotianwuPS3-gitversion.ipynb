I was born in Venezuela and have always worked on both English and Spanish, and am able to teach both languages.  My dream was to have a home in Hawaii.  I've have spent the last few years traveling  between CA  and many of the Hawaiian Islands in search of the perfect home.  We are settling on the shores of this quaint village.  I am married with one 15 year old son, and one dog Max. I love to hike and the kings trail is close to this house. I love nature and there are wild goats over on Umi street. I love to watch movies and there is netflix at the house. I love geckos and there are brown and green ones at the house. I like deals and the Aloha Beach house is one! There is a king bed now in the master- everytime we go we make the house nicer! It's nicer than our house in California. The master bedroom downstairs is very large and has a queen bed and futon. House can accomodate large groups; I just have to charge extra due to utilities. We get lots of family groups!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis beach house has been a 30 year dream in the making!  It is always so incredible when you see your dreams come true with belief and hard work. Please come and share the  Fantastic Sunsets at  Makai Hideaway- The sunsets are phenomenal and the snorkeling / swimming hole is a two minute walk from the house. The beach is a 15 minute hike from the community center in Milolii. I just enjoyed Easter services with the local people and it was wonderful at the little yellow church in the village. It really is a special place set  near  the last hawaiian fishing village\\r\\n\",\n",

The house is equipped with a lot of stuff that one might ever need for vacation: kayaks, tennis table, board games, TV with Netflix subscription, freezer with ice maker, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nLynn, the house manager, was very welcoming and helpful. She made a nice intro when we arrived and tried to do whatever necessary to make our stay more pleasant. When we found ants in the kitchen, we told Lynn, and the next day the problem was solved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drawback I can think of is the lack of sound proofness, so when somebody goes to a bathroom it can be heard from the neighboring room.

We found the location to be a great launching point to go to Kona and Hilo.  The house is situated near a historic fishing village and is on a lava field in a quiet community.  Don't let the trip down from the highway intimidate you, just take it slow, the end result is so worth the few miles of curvy road.  The view of the Pacific was amazing!  Cheryl and Lynn were so accommodating and even worked with us so we could stay an extra night.  They provided tips on where to go and helped orient us to the island.  When we come back to the Big Island, we will definitely stay at the Aloha Beach House.  We hope to be back soon. \"},\n",

She gave us some very good information for us to plan our trip and shared some great storied from her own experience. She recommend an awesome bakery on our way to the volcano park. She also helped fix the TV promptly. The location is a little far from the popular area.

The drive down the hill is not for someone like my other (who is terrified of hights) but I loved driving it.  One of the best beaches on the island is only a 10 minute drive and 20 minute hike away, but be aware, you all have to drive to anywhere on this island. We brought some clothing detergent and left it and some salt and paper, we also left a card for the Big Island Chocolate Store frequent buyer card so the next people can take advantage of it and get some free chocolate.

Also, the swim/snorkel area 1.5 blocks away is not a beach (its a rocky lava shore) and not the safest feeling -- Homolino is great though, as are other places you can drive to. Finally, Cheryl openly admits this, but it is really far from stores, restaurants, etc (30-60m depending). Just things to keep in mind.'},\n",

Dolphin tour is must see! Only thing is that house does not have A/C (still have lots of fans in every room), so if  you stay in the house all day it might be little uncomfortable (at least it was for us those 2 days we did not go anywhere), but you won't find A/C in most places anyway.  \\r\\nIt was the best vacation we have ever had!

We always stop at the South Kona Fruit Stand for smoothies before arriving at the Aloha Beach House. Amazing snorkeling in Honomalino Bay (get there early and you'll be treated to hours of entertainment by dolphins with no one else around). Quick drive over to Volcano National Park and super easy to all other attractions the Big Island has to offer. When you return to the Beach House, fire up the grill for dinner and enjoy your delicious Hawaiian meal on the deck.

We loved the location, since it was off the beaten path, giving us easy access to explore places that may not be seen by most visitors to the big island.  We loved jumping in the water first thing in the morning.  There is an easy place to hop in and enjoy world class snorkeling just a two minute walk away, and with snorkel gear provided, as well as boogie boards and kayaks, exploration is a must.  We highly recommend this house to anyone looking for a vacation away from the resorts and standard tourist fare.

We felt incredibly privileged that she shares her wonderful home. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, the location: One of the things that the Big Island is known for is its volcanoes and lava. Other than seeing actual flowing lava (which wasn't possible during our stay), one can pretty much experience the same at the seaside house. The house is on actual lava flow and one can see and experience the lava field the community is built upon. In addition, one can see and hear the ocean and the beautiful coastline from the house. There is a small black sand beach less than 20 minutes away as well as another swimming/snorkeling location less than 5 minutes (walking!) away. In short, the location is beautiful!\\r\\n\\r\\nHospitality: It is the little things that count: an up-to-date 2014 travel guide for the Big Island that we brought with us on our daily excursions, Hawaiian music CDs, DVDs, wifi, kitchen utensils, bowls and everything else you'd need to cook, laundry room, game room, water fun activity stuff...we really couldn't have asked for anything more during our stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe process: Cheryl was very responsive to our request to book, even though we contacted her last minute. She is very friendly and answered all of our questions promptly. Her directions were excellent, we had no problem finding the house at night. Daniel the local caretaker is a fount of local information, providing tips on what is worth the time and money and what is just a tourist trap. \\r\\n\\r\\nOther miscellaneous thoughts: the house is a ways away from the main tourist area of Kona, which is great because you can enjoy your stay away from tourists. Also, the house is great value to share with some friends as there are plenty of sleeping places. \\r\\n\"},\n",

Plenty of space to sit and relax (although we were usually out and about) and the extra goodies (kayaks, snorkeling gear, boogie boards) were so great to have.  Don't worry about bringing snorkel gear as there are about ten full sets.\\n\\nAs previous reviews suggested, the house is a bit out of the way (roughly an hour south of Kona and fifteen minutes down a winding road of switchbacks).  This was not too big a deal for us since it's the Big Island and we knew we would be doing a lot of driving.\\n\\nThere are four beds in the house and a few additional sleeping spaces (a futon, air mattress, and sofa bed).  We had 8 adults, and not all were couples, so it was a tad constricting.  One was in the futon and another in the air mattress.  Not too bad for the week we were there, but any additional time might have seemed cramped.\\n\\nCheryl is great at communication leading up to the trip.  I had several questions and she usually responded within minutes.\\n\\nDaniel, who watches over the house since Cheryl doesn't live in the area, is a treasure trove of information.  He is very fun and loves to help with any planning.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend the house.  Just make sure it is the right fit for your size group and what you're wanting to do.\"},\n",

We stocked up food at Costco & Choicemart, and ate gourmet meals every night. The lanai is large and comfy, and with fans and the breeze we didn't need AC.  Miloli is in a fairly isolated location, but that also is a positive if you aren't looking for hordes of tourists (we weren't), and it is much closer to the Volcano Park than other places on the Kona side. Cheryl was great to work with and very attentive to our needs. Daniel the host is very welcoming, and so are the other neighbors. The ocean is fabulous there, crashing surf vs.lava.  The house is accommodating and comfy, and cutely decorated. The ping-pong table was well-used by us, as was the kitchen.  The price was very reasonable for everything provided.  Overall, a great week - thanks, Cheryl ! \"},\n",

There was also lots of water gear which we were grateful to have for our trips to the beach.  We especially enjoyed the spacious lanai where we had all our meals.  The house has a great view of the ocean and we were able to watch wales breaching in the evenings through binoculars provided by Cheryl.

We liked the place, sunny, close to the ocean (no sandy beach like everywhere on Big Island, but good enough to swim), just 100 meters from rocky steps to the ocean. One thing made us upset - this place is really far from everything and to get there you drive from the highway down along mountain serpentine for 5 miles. For a short stay is not convenient, good for a long relaxing vacation.'},\n",

We had zero problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house itself is great. While there were only four of us on this trip, the house could easily accommodate twice that many. The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms well stocked with shampoo, soap, sunscreen, ointments, etc., and the view of the ocean off the front lanai was excellent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kitchen is well stocked with everything you need to make good food, and the living area has comfortable furniture and even amenities like Netflix.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe caretaker, \"Uncle\" Dan, was friendly and outgoing. He is also a fount of local information, and he gave us directions to an excellent local beach. This beach is hard to get to, but is fantastic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house also has just about everything you need for an island stay: many pairs of snorkels and flippers, kayaks, body boards, water shoes, and numerous other stuff to make your stay pleasant. The fact that you are a one minute walk from excellent snorkeling in the bay doesn\\'t, hurt, either.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe listing is very accurate, and the photos match the house. The house itself is very nicely appointed with nice art and colours. It didn\\'t feel like we were invading anyone\\'s personal space, and it was very comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only \"drawback\" has more to do with the island itself than the house. It is fairly remote, and it takes a lot of driving to get anywhere. Not that distances as so far: you can only drive about 35 mph / 60 km/h, so it takes a while to get anywhere. The twisty roads take some getting used to, especially for a Canadian who\\'s used to wide open spaces and straight roads. None of this detracts from the house, which was exactly as advertized.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the house was what we expected, the hosts were fantastic, and the view of the ocean off the lanai is great. We had an excellent time, and I would recommend this house to anyone who wants to \"get away from it all\" in a secluded location.'},\n",

We loved spending time in the bright living room surrounded by views of the ocean and on the wrap around balcony. Daniel greeted us and made us feel welcome - he was full of insider knowledge and great tips. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is at the bottom of a steep and winding road - the drive down from the highway takes 10-15 minutes depending on your comfort. The road is well paved and you do not need a 4 wheel drive.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything you could need for the beach is provided, including snorkel gear and kayaks. Although we didn't have the opportunity to use the kayaks or the snorkel gear because the waves were very rough near the house - I think this is uncommon and was due to a swell passing through. There are 3 good size bedrooms plus a queen bed in the game room. I think the house could comfortably sleep 4 couples plus a couple of children on air mattresses and pull out couches. Note that the game room, bathroom, and large bedroom downstairs are not connected to the main living space upstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolcano National Park is about 1 - 1.5 hours away and Hilo can be reached in 2 hours with no traffic, if you really book it (we were late for a flight). Captain Cook is not too far, but the traffic took us nearly an hour. Make sure to bring your own food to the house. All kitchen items are provided.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe only wish we could have stayed longer. I think the house is a great place to relax and enjoy the quiet and wonderful view. There are some wonderful hikes nearby and Volcano National Park is not too far. We're hoping to bring our family back.\"},\n",

By having Cheryl check in a few times before the scheduled arrival it made me feel like she was there and not just a hotel that you check in/out and thats it. Cheryl you made it a very personal experience and that is nice. Thank you.  I think the only description that I either missed or was not there was just the windy roads to mile marker 89 and the 3 miles down to the subdivision. I am very glad we arrived in daylight as the road could have been a  little scary in the dark first time round. Some people may not enjoy those trips daily up/down that road. Might be nice as a heads up for potential guests. Just a thought. The sunsets views as well as the sunrises were incredible. That was spot on. The neighborhood was very quiet and felt really safe there (when we were there). I think the place was fantastic. I sure hope that the new houses going up don't affect the view but really unless it is a high rise the views will still be spectacular. Location was great. Close to Volcano, South Point and  getting to Hilo. It was also great heading back into Kona. Windy roads definitely slow travel down but gets you to look at all the local land. We did not even have to spend money on snorkeling trips as we had enough gear and enough beaches to go do it ourselves. Tons of dolphins within feet of us. Turtles. Many fishes and we believe one small shark! I mean the beauty was everywhere. Just know that the beaches nearby are not your typical sandy white beaches but beautiful in their own special ways. Make a point to eat local kine foods. Markets, fruit/vege stands all over. Fresh fish. Cook at the house....We had a few of our best meals at home and local grown foods. No paid for luau needed. I got to eat poi daily. ONOLICIOUS! Mahalo nui Cheryl for a beautiful comfortable home and the most perfect lanai. Until next time. \"},\n",

We all thoroughly enjoyed the comfort of the house and there were lots of extras in the property which made it homely and also came in very useful (kayak & snorkeling gear).  It is off the main road near the ocean so it feels very calm at night, good if you are just wanting to get away from it all.  It also makes perfect viewing for starts at night.  During the day you can take advantage of being a short drive to the volcano national park, the black or green sand beaches or a drive up to Kona or Hilo...of course there is a lot of things in the house so you could just relax there or wander down to the local fishing village and buy some fresh fish.  We did this and had a BBQ on the decking.  It was a nice way to spend our last night.  We were there 4 nights 5 days and will definitely be back...there is still SOOOOO much to do!

The property is set up as a nice beach house or a lake side cottage for that matter and has enough space to sleep large groups of up to 9.  The house has 3 bathrooms and modern amenities such as WiFi and a lot of beach friendly gear such as fins, snorkeling equipment, body boards, and kayaks.  There is a great DVD collection as well, specially for kids.  Enough has been said about Daniel, the wonderful neighbor and caretaker, in past reviews but I must add that he makes the stay all the more pleasant and comfortable.  He knows the Island very well and will give you valuable advice on activities and excursions among other things.  Cheryl is a great host and promptly responded to all of our inquiries and questions and made sure that we were set up for a great time prior to arrival.  Please note that the nearest supermarkets are near Kona which is a 45 minute drive so when Cheryl tells you to do grocery shopping prior to showing up at the Beach House on the first day, please take that advice.  This is a great location for visiting Volcano National Park but it is a bit of a drive if you want to visit places such as Mauna Key and Hilo so factor that into planning excursions as well.   \"},\n",

       "    'comments': \"This location was great for the price. We originally had a larger party and our hands were tied for bed space. Some dropped out of the trip, but we decided to keep our reservation. We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of gear and the plethora of sizes the home had (kayaks, snorkels, and even water shoes). Sometimes places boast these things and they never fit or there isn't enough for everyone, but for our party of 5 there was plenty. \\r\\n\\r\\nCheryl and Daniel were great and made our late arrival very easy. There are plenty of guides and brochures in the home for activities, though everything will take some time to drive to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kitchen was very nice, though ants can be a problem if you leave anything on the counter. The geckos were cute to all but one in our party who doesn't like lizards.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord of warning, my boyfriend and I got eaten alive by some type of bug the first night (not sure when it happened - maybe while eating dinner outside on the patio... these weren't the typical mosquito bites - maybe fleas?), so be sure to apply plenty of bug repellent. We didn't get any more bites after using some, but it made the rest of the trip pretty uncomfortable (they were all over our feet so we couldn't wear proper shoes without discomfort). The others in our party were fine (only a couple of mosquito bites here and there). We didn't tell our hosts until the end of the trip, so there wasn't much they could do, but they said they do spray the home for pests every month. They can't help the location after all (it's a tropical island! We only wish we were better prepared)\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, if you know what you are getting (remote, quiet, private location right on the beach), don't mind not having AC, and wear plenty of bug repellent this place is a great stay. \"},\n",

Upstairs is spacious, the rooms are nice. The patio is lovely, with a great view. The host is very thoughtful in the selection of beach equipment, books, and DVDs which made our trip even more enjoyable. \\nThe room downstairs is in a recreation room with a pool and ping pong table. The mattress of the bed is very uncomfortable, and the noise from the water heater is disruptive, meaning one cannot use water at night.

It\\'s not often that a place is better than you expect, but this time it was. We love the South Kona area, warm days, cool nights, ocean breeze, stars fill the night sky, watch wales from the deck, waves splashing on the lava, very few bugs and the ones that were there got zapped by the largest bug zapper we have every seen. And best sunsets ever, first night we saw the Green Splash! Walk or hike the area and Daniel will tell you how to get to a very private black sand beach and some other places to visit, such as Hookena  Beach Park, only a short drive. Wish we had gone there our first day, as we waited our last day to visit this beach and still got to swim with the Dolphins. WOW! If you decide to go to this beach, go early as the parking fills up fast.  So spend some time talking with Daniel, you will be glad you did and he is a great guy and our new friend. We spent two weeks at Cheryl\\'s home and could have spent two more. Everything you need and more is at this house. Next time we are going to make it three weeks. Mahalo Cheryl. Aloha, Gary & Dee & Family (February 2017) Hey guys, this was my Valentine\\'s Gift to my Wife. Happy Wife, Happy Life! Aloha '},\n",

The area is not exactly what you'd expect for Hawaiian scenery--it is in a community built on lava rocks--but it is relaxing nonetheless. The house has several high-quality kayaks that are free to use, and is very close to a very scenic cove where is excellent to use them. We spent a full day kayaking to a nearby beach, where we used sand toys that were also provided in the house.\\n\\nThe only downside for the house is the location: it is quite a ways south of Captain Cook, and the last few miles are down an exceptionally windy road. If you plan to travel in to Captain Cook or Kona every day, then the drive might get a bit tiresome. But you won't find a house that has nearly as good a deal as this anywhere near the cities, so you get what you pay for. For us, the opportunity to rent such a wonderful and large home for such a great rate more than made up for the commute.\"},\n",

       "    'comments': \"This home has something for everyone, from snorkels, to kayaks, boogie boards, and even a full set of dvd's and other entertainment to wind down after a long day out in the sun. If you're concerned with the lack of AC there's nothing better than opening up the sliding doors and letting the cool ocean breeze in. The view from the deck is beautiful, it's the perfect spot to enjoy your morning coffee or a nice homemade breakfast. Daniel was very helpful with planning out our days and the House Manual (the yellow folder) also has great suggestions for more places to explore.\\n\\nAll in all this house provides you with everything you need to enjoy your days on the Big Island. The rough winding road down may be tricky but definitely worth the drive overlooking a picturesque community atop majestic lava rocks. This home is definitely a rare find and the atmosphere is something everyone should seize the opportunity to experience. We loved our stay and only wish we had a few days more to enjoy it!!\"},\n",

Then we would enjoy our breakfast and coffee outside on the patio soaking in the incredible view. We were so thankful for all the amenities the house had to offer. We took the kayaks and the snorkeling gear to the near by beach and had a blast. If you are looking to have some fun, adventure, or even some peace and quiet look no further this is the spot. Also throughout the whole process cheryl and Daniel were easily accessible and always available for communication. Can’t say enough good things about our experience, looking forward to hopefully visiting again someday soon.'},\n",

       "    'comments': \"My visit to the Makai Hideaway was my first time in Hawai’I and my first time on Airbnb. We couldn’t have made a better choice. Cheryl has a beautiful house in a great location. We were 7 adults celebrating my daughter’s college graduation and our 32nd anniversary in May 2018. After we planned the trip, Kilaueua erupted and that made us even more excited to visit. Unfortunately, it also meant vog on our side of the island, eliminating the Fantastic Sunsets part of the equation. But it also meant less direct sun, so much cooler. Cheryl’s house is ideal if you want to get away from the madding crowd, but have access to all the Big Island has to offer. We were out of the house every day by 7am and back in time to make dinner and enjoy each other’s company. Our itinerary included Honomalino Beach, South Point, Discovery Harbor, Green Sand Beach, Punalu'u Black Sand Beach, Hilo, Rainbow Falls, Mauna Kea, Makalawena Beach, Kahalu’u Beach Park, Kealakekua Bay (visit Ehu & Kai Adventures for rentals – family-owned!), Captain Cook monument, and the City of Refuge - Pu'uhonua O Hōnaunau National Historical Park. All with Miloli’I as our home base. It IS 10 minutes off the hwy down a winding road with a 1500-foot drop in elevation, but that’s a good thing to me! There was nothing we needed that wasn’t already in the house, except food, but including spices. The property description is excellent; the house is exactly as described. One thing that I didn’t pick up on is that the water cistern isn’t for drinking water – Cheryl provides that in a couple of water cooler/dispensers with plenty of extra jugs of water. But water became our only problem – more below. Thought we would use the ping pong & pool tables, but no time – we were never in the house. Never turned the TVs on either. The house did get hot after being locked up all day, but it cooled off fast with so many windows and screen doors and fans. Costco IS a sensible first stop before coming to the house. We planned out our meals and got most all the ingredients there. We ended up with too much food though, and took most of the excess over to Pahoa to donate to the Leilani Estates evacuation center. Funny though; we didn’t seem to have an excess of alcohol.  But as with most marvelous properties, everything’s great as long as everything’s great. But what happens when something happens? I think that’s when you find out what kind of host you have. For us, it came on the 7th day- no water came out of the faucets. We let Cheryl & Daniel know, and they immediately went to work trying to find the problem. It turned out we were out of water, which was a little odd since we were fairly conservative on water use and the house has a big tank. But Daniel...\"},\n",

       "    'comments': 'Everything went well. We stayed there for two days for an event down at Milolii. The whole house was already opened for us upon arrival and I had to sign a form that Daniel brought personally to the home. There were no sponges to wash dishes but was addressed by owner quickly and the manager Daniel brought them by. Upon arrival the house was extremely hot, like an oven with only 2 fans for the 14 people upstairs and downstairs. By the next morning the house cooled down much and was fine for the rest of our stay. Would recommend adding fans for every room in the future. The water was not drinkable due to the machines spitting out white particles even when we changed bottles so we were lucky we brought our own as this house is on catchment. The house was nicely decorated and very beautiful and mostly clean. It had EVERYTHING we needed from paper plates to fresh coffee and creamer and lots of dishes, dishwasher, towels etc which was a great touch. There was even a cute disco ball, pool table in the living room.  Daniel was kind of strange but didn’t bother us besides check in and we were thankful to Cheryl for her accommodating such a large group and think she really puts thought and time into her airBnB even though she is in the mainland. There is a cliff-ocean view and beautiful starry skies but the beach is a small drive away. All in all we would stay here again and thought the overall experience was great for the reason we stayed.'},\n",

It was spacious and clean and offered great amenities for the kids to play as well as what you would need to take to the beach  The morning view was my favorite, very relaxing and beautiful. The kids loved the adventures to the water and discovering hidden gems.  The community has a speed limit of 15 mph with very little traffic so the kids were able to walk and play carefree outside.  This made my 6th trip to Hawaii (first to Kona) and it was simply wonderful. The house is on the south end of the island which is good in regards to proximity to beautiful beaches that are not crowded, including the one by the house past the village (just be prepared for a bit of a hike but it is well worth it when you arrive)  My kids and I managed to make it to 5 different beaches (1 of them 2 x) Our favorite was Punalu'u Black sand beach (sea turtles).  If you want to relax or hike or have an adventure Cheryl's house puts you in the right place to do so.\"},\n",

It was a few minute walk to the ocean, but not necessarily the beach you would consider safe to swim in.  The coast is a cliff made of lava rock and a rope to pull yourself up/down to.  During the times we walked in the morning and evening (in February) the waves were crashing strongly into that coast line so we refrained from getting in.  The home is has a lot of amenities and activities for young families with kids (games, snorkel equipment, movies, etc).  Unfortunately for our stay, the place didn’t appear to be cleaned properly.  With proper cleaning, the place would be charming and perfect for families looking for a quiet place with a view.'}]}]"
